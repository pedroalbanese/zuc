## GM/T 0001-2012 Zu Chongzhi stream cipher 
### Confidentiality algorithm 128-EEA3 and the 3GPP integrity algorithm 128-EIA3.

ZUC is a stream cipher that forms the basis of the 128-EEA3 and 128-EIA3 cryptographic algorithms utilised within LTE networks. The 128-EEA3 is the 128 bit encryption algorithm defined using ZUC and the 128-EIA3 is the EPS Integrity Algorithm designed as a Universal Hash Function using ZUC at its core. Following agreements in 2009 for a requirement for a third LTE encryption and integrity algorithm set, 128-EEA and 128-EIA were designed in China. The algorithm set is based on a core stream cipher algorithm named ZUC, after Zu Chongzhi, a famous Chinese scientist.
